# My first Deep Learning Project!  :)
# Animal Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify animals into different categories.
By leveraging a labeled dataset of animal images, the model learns to identify and categorize animals based on their visual features.

## 🌟 Features
- CNN Architecture: Includes multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Data Augmentation: Uses techniques like flipping, rotation, and zooming to enhance the model's generalization.
- Performance Metrics: Tracks accuracy, precision

## ⚠️ Drawbacks
- less number of dataset.


## 📊 Results
| Accuracy         | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Training         | 65%   |
| Validation       | 45%   |
