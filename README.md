#My first Deep Learning Project!  :)
#Animal Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
##ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify animals into different categories.
By leveraging a labeled dataset of animal images, the model learns to identify and categorize animals based on their visual features.
##ðŸŒŸ Features
1). CNN Architecture: Includes multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
2). Data Augmentation: Uses techniques like flipping, rotation, and zooming to enhance the model's generalization.
3). Performance Metrics: Tracks accuracy, precision
##DrawBack
Though the model creation was easy, the number of dataset was quit low which result in low traning accuracy of about 65% and validation accuracy of 45%.
Open to any feedback to improve the model.
